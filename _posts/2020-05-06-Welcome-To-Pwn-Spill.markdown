As the title suggests, welcome to PwnSpill! This is a blog about my journey in pwning (binary exploitation).

I hope to take this difficult topic and spread the joy of pwning to others. 

This blog will consist of lots of writeups, and explanations about various topics. Some posts may even just tell you about great resources that have personally helped me in my pwning journey.

Enjoy!
